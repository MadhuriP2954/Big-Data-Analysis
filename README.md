##IPL Player Match Analysis##

This project analyzes IPL player and match data using PySpark for efficient data processing and manipulation. The dataset includes comprehensive details about players, matches, and their performance metrics. The project demonstrates data enrichment, dynamic column creation, and exploratory insights based on key player attributes like age, batting/bowling style, and career duration.

##Features
Dynamic Calculations:

Added player age at the time of the match (age_as_on_match).
Calculated years since debut (years_since_debut).
Veteran Status Classification:

Categorized players as "Veteran" or "Non-Veteran" based on their age.
##Enriched Dataset:

Integrated player, match, and team information.
Highlighted key attributes like batting/bowling skills, captain/keeper roles, and team performance.
Tools & Technologies
PySpark: For distributed data processing and transformation.
DataFrame API: To manage and manipulate structured data efficiently.
SQL Functions: For dynamic column creation and conditional transformations.
Sample Dataset Columns
player_id: Unique identifier for players.
player_name: Name of the player.
batting_hand & bowling_skill: Player's batting and bowling styles.
season_year: Year of the IPL season.
age_as_on_match: Calculated age of the player during the match.
veteran_status: Categorization into "Veteran" or "Non-Veteran."
years_since_debut: Dynamic calculation showing career duration.
Highlights
Enriches raw IPL datasets with meaningful insights and categorizations.
Demonstrates real-world use cases for PySpark in sports analytics.
Provides an intuitive understanding of player attributes and their evolution over time.
